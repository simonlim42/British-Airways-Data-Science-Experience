# Airline Sentiment Analysis and Csutomer Booking Prediction

## Notebook 1: Sentiment Analysis using on British Airways Reviews

In the "Web scraping and Sentiment analysis" notebook, I utilized Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze sentiments expressed in reviews of British Airways. The primary steps include web scraping to gather the reviews and applying various NLP methods to extract insights into customer sentiments. The notebook provides a detailed walkthrough of the process, from data collection to sentiment analysis, and includes visualizations to enhance the understanding of the results.

### Key Features:
- Web scraping for British Airways reviews.
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for sentiment analysis.
- Visualizations to showcase sentiment trends (Wordcloud, Top topics).

## Notebook 2: Customer Booking Prediction with Random Forest

The "Predictive modelling of customer bookings" notebook focuses on predicting customer bookings using machine learning techniques, specifically employing the ** Random Forest** algorithm. The notebook begins with comprehensive data cleaning to ensure the dataset's quality. Next, I trained a Random Forest model using specific features to predict whether a customer would make a booking. The notebook includes detailed visualizations, performance analysis, and the exploration of different feature sets to enhance the predictive accuracy of the model.

### Key Features:
- Data cleaning for preprocessing the dataset.
- Implementation of the Random Forest algorithm for booking prediction.
- Visualizations and analysis of model performance.
- Experimentation with different sets of features to optimize the model.
